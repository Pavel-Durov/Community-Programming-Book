# Disadvantages

Compiled code is usually seen as an advantage, but it also has its own drawbacks. If you change any part of your code, you must recompile the whole application, this makes the deployment process a bit tedious.

Even though C# is a compiled language, it's not as fast as native code compiled languages. The two main reason for that is that C# is compiled to IL (intermediate language) instead of machine code and the overhead added by the GC (garbage collector)

Finally, even though C# is a Cross-Platform, it is still used mainly within .Net ecosystem and you most likely to see C# on Windows based OS, but it's gaining popularity (especially since .NET Core release) in latest years and can be seen on other platforms such as Mac and Linux.
