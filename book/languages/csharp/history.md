# History

C# was Developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft as part of .NET framework initiative in the late 2000's.

The name comes from a musical notation where a sharp symbol sets the note higher in pitch by one semitone, which is similar to the story of the C++ name, where ++ being the increment operator. 
some say that the sharp symbol also resembles a four "+" symbols (in a 2x2 grid), implying that the language is an increment of C++.

In its early 1.0 version, C# looked a lot like it's predecessor Java (released in 1991). 
But it has grown quickly since it was first created, with extensive support from Microsoft promoting C# as it's primary .NET framework language it gained a large audience and became one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

By the time this chapter was written, C# version stands at 7.0 and is continuously evolving.
